# Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm

## Overview
ECDSA is a public key cryptography encryption algorithms used by popular blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin. It has enabled large public-key identity registries, putting the building blocks for user-controlled digital identity in the hands of millions of people. Anyone can create a public/private key pair, hold digital assets, and participate in a wide ecosystem of decentralized applications using tools for signing and authentication.

Within the context of ZK, supporting ECDSA within circuits allows users to attest to on chain facts, in a privacy preserving way. Users can now prove and compose arbitrary claims about knowledge of private keys, membership in groups, possession of attestations, and more, e.g. *I can prove I own a wallet with over X in funds, without doxing my address*.

## Technical Brief
Given a ECDSA keypair of $(k_{priv}, k_{pub}*)$ over an appropriate $({\textrm {CURVE}},G,n)$ where $G$ is a generator point on the curve, $n$ is the multiplicative order of the point G, and $k_{pub}=k_{priv}\times G$

### Signature Generation
A message $m$ is signed as follows: 
1. ${\displaystyle h={\textrm {HASH}}(m)}$, trimmed to the leftmost bits, up to the bit length of the group order $n$. See [hashes](/docs/primitives/hashes)
2. Calculate a point: $(x_{1},y_{1})=k\times G$ where $k$ is a random number in ${\displaystyle [1,n-1]}$
3. Calculate $r=x_{1}\,{\bmod {\,}}n$
4. Calculate ${\displaystyle s=k^{-1}(h+rk_{priv})\,{\bmod {\,}}n}$

$(r,s)$ is the resulting signature

### Signature Verification
1. Check that $k_{pub}$ is a valid point on $\textrm {CURVE}$
2. Check ${\displaystyle h={\textrm {HASH}}(m)}$
3. Calculate ${\displaystyle u_{1}=hs^{-1}\,{\bmod {\,}}n}$ and ${\displaystyle u_{2}=rs^{-1}\,{\bmod {\,}}n}$.
4. Calculate a point ${\displaystyle (x_{1},y_{1})=u_{1}\times G+u_{2}\times k_{pub}}$. 
5. Check ${\displaystyle (x_{1},y_{1})!=O}$
5. Check ${\displaystyle r\equiv x_{1}{\pmod {n}}}$
