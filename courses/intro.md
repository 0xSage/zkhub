# Courses
0xPARC runs **applied ZK learning groups** for researchers and developers interested in learning about zero-knowledge cryptography and its applications.

The purpose of this course is to help you learn to build with ZK crypto. This program is meant to be something in between "class about applied crypto", "talk series", and "reading and building with ZK crypto in a self-driven way with guidance."

This page is a collection of readings, speaker recordings, and exercises from previous cohorts you can follow anytime.

Contact: For questions on upcoming cohorts, email hello@0xPARC.org.

## Topics Covered

The core focus is in using the circom / snarkjs toolstack to build ZK crypto applications. We expect that many of these may be decentralized applications, and may therefore require participants to learn the basics of Solidity as well. Subtopics include:

The circom programming language.
- Analysis and breakdown of common ZK circuits or components--comparators, bit operations, SNARK-friendly hash functions, selectors, quantization, and more.
- Analysis and breakdown of known ZK constructions and apps--such as Dark Forest, StealthDrop, EthDataMarketplace, tornado.cash, Semaphore, MACI.
- Developer tools--hardhat-circom, ZK-REPL and more.

The course aims to give participants a wider understanding of the space, beyond just application development. Adjacent or auxiliary topics may include:

- Trusted setup theory, tooling, and infrastructure.
- The different zkSNARK protocols used in production, and the tradeoffs between them.
- zkSNARKs and cryptography under the hood: the theory/math that makes zkSNARKs possible.
- Other zkSNARK toolstacks.
