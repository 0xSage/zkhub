## Description

The second circom workshop: we dig deeper into a few key circuits such as zk-group-sig, isZero, and Num2Bits.

## Pre-Session Reading/Setup

Circom workshop #1 would be helpful as they build on each other.

## Optional Homework

To check your understanding, we'd recommend trying to implement any of IsZero, IsEqual, Num2Bits, GreaterThan, QuinSelector, RangeProof, IsNegative, or Modulo by hand without just copy-pasting code from circomlib or references.

- IsZero, IsEqual, Num2Bits, GreaterThan can be found in circomlib (comparators and bitify), and do what you'd expect them to do.
- QuinSelector is a circuit that takes as input an array in[nElements], an index `index`, and outputs the value of in[index].
- RangeProof is a circuit that takes in `upper` `lower` and `test`, outputs 1 if test is in the range and 0 otherwise.
- IsNegative is a circuit that takes in an input, outputs 1 if input is negative and 0 otherwise. We define a convention: "Negative" is by convention considered to be any residue in (p/2, p-1], and Positive is anything in [1, p/2)
- Modulo (hard) takes in a dividend and divisor, and outputs a quotient and remainder. it is acceptable to first range proof your dividend and divisor to be at most some large number (say 1e12), and assume that everything is positive.
- QuinSelector, RangeProof, IsNegative, and Modulo can be found in the dark forest circuits repo [https://github.com/darkforest-eth/circuits/tree/master/perlin](https://github.com/darkforest-eth/circuits/tree/master/perlin)
