The first ZK Learning Group presented their summaries and demos for 6 projects on December 23, 2021. These projects that presented were:

* ECDSA Signature scheme in groth16
* Anonymity-preserving proof of NFT ownership
* Machine learning within a SNARK
* Circom IDE in the browser
* NFT mixer
* Private attestations
* Circom DSL

These groups have since branched off into another working group code named ZK Identity Working group, which works to further zero knowledge within the context of the web3 identity space.
